#Statistics
- Mean: average
- Mode: most frequent value
- Median: middle Value

-Note that frequency density should be used when making a bar graph of frequency if the classes are uneven

####Interpolation
-Interpolation is required to determine the median of grouped data
$$
\text{median}=L+I(\frac{\frac{N}{2}-F}{f})
$$
Where $L$ is the lower bound of the interval containing the median, $I$ is the width of the interval containing the median, $N$ is the number of values in the dataset, $F$ is the cumulative frequency to the lower limit, and $f$ is the frequency of the interval containing the median.
####Interquartile Range
$$
\text{Interquartile Range}=Q_3-Q_1
$$
$Q_3$ is the value of the $75^\text{th}$ percentile and $Q_1$ is the value of the $25^\text{th}$ percentile
####Standard Deviation
$$
\text{variance}=\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n}
$$
alternatively, the computational form is used for things
$$
\text{variance}=\frac{\sum x^2-\frac{(\sum x)^2}{n}}{n}
$$
Furthermore,
$$
\text{standard deviation}=\sqrt{\text{variance}}
$$
-when using a calculator to find variance, it is listed as $\sigma (x)$
-To find the standard deviation of a frequency table with classes, use a class mark (the midpoint of the class)
