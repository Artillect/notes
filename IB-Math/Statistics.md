#Statistics
- Mean: average
- Mode: most frequent value
- Median: middle Value

-Note that frequency density should be used when making a bar graph of frequency if the classes are uneven

####Interpolation
-Interpolation is required to determine the median of grouped data
$$
\text{median}=L+I(\frac{\frac{N}{2}-F}{f})
$$
