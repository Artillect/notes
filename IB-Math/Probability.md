#Probability
####Addition Law
$$
P(A\text{ or }B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\text{ and }B)
$$
alternatively,
$$
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)
$$
If the events are disjoint (mutually exclusive), like a coin toss, then $P(A\text{ and } B)=0$
####Product Law
$$
P(A \text{ and }B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)
$$
This only holds true if and only if events A and B are independent

####Conditional Probability
$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \text{ and } B)}{P(B)}
$$
$P(A|B)$ is the notation for the probability of event A given event B being true or having occurred.
####Bayes' Theorem
$$

$$
####Binomial Theorem
$$
P(r \text{ successes in }n \text{ trials})={{n}\choose{r}}\cdot p^r \cdot q^{(n-r)}
$$
The expected value of a binomial distribution $=np$
